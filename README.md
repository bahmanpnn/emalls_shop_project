# emalls_shop_project
this is one of my first intermeditate projects from django courses and needs to improve but it works and i liked to share it here.it just has a problem in 3 parts that i commented them in codes.they are product comments,search box in header and email contacting box in footer.i will make it better but if you can make it better i will be happy if you share it with me.

#HOW_TO_INSTALL

first install venv(virtual environment)
then install requirements.txt packeges 
and then,migrate
at last you must createsuper user for add product and settings;without creating super user it works but without adding products site seem's bad!
