# emalls_shop_project
## this is one of my first project that i learned from a django course                 
        
          
      
#HOW_TO_INSTALL

1- python -m venv venv ==> (virtual environment)                        
2- pip install -r requirements.txt             
3- python manage.py migrate                     
4- python manage.py createsuperuser  ==> at last you must createsuper user to add product and set settings(like adding logo and others);without creating super user it works but without adding products the site looks bad!
